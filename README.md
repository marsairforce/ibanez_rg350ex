# Ibanez RG350EX

I got this in 2009 from Fleet Pro sound. I think for what ever reason I was missing my Mexican Strat after I sold it before moving back to Winnipeg following the intern at Nortel. By now I was back in Ottawa and had wanted to get back into Guitar. I still had my ADA microtube 200, boss VF1.

I tried to get into playing it but it sounded terrible. Maybe the Boss VF1 was old and not very good?

I got the Digitech GSP1101 from Sweetwater. I remember that. The fucking shipping and duty and tax was like more than the actual unit cost.
But the guitar still sounded terrible. So it sat in the furnace room.

## Change log

## 2019-02-20

Push pull pots arrived. Install them.

* One is push pull for the phase switch.
* Other is for tone control enable/disable (though it doesn't seem to be noticable if i dial tone all the way over).
* The old phase change toggle switches are now coil series / parallel switches. I followed their [diagram](https://www.seymourduncan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WD_Pushpull_minitoggle_3.pdf)

Apply some linseed oil to the fretboard. Clean it up pretty good. It looks great now.

New strings, Ernie ball super slinky. Sound really great.

Order two new potentiometers from DigiKey. The volume pot feels scratchy and hard to turn lately. Probably it is cheap and breaking on me.

* Wanting to have a push/pull switch on the tone knob to have it disconnect itself all together.
* Wanting to remove the phase reverse switches. With only 2 pickups one will always be out of phase with the other one. we need to have just one phase control switch then. Maybe consider removing the phase control switches and using a switch under the volume pot to push/pull to invert the phase of the bridge pickup. Though at the moment I do not have a need for 2 switches, and not wanting to remove the switches and leave holes. And not wanting to rewire things unless I need to
* I don't think I want to get into coil splitting at this time. But having the extra switch would let me do that too.
* Watch some more youtube. Ok, doing a series/parallel wiring would be good for changing the tone. And freeing up these 2 toggle switches from the phase shift and using a push pull knob switch for that should be good. And then toggle switches as https://www.seymourduncan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WD_Pushpull_minitoggle_3.pdf

Order the SH8 neck pickup for Valentines day present. Put it in. Sounds great. That old pickup was a piece of shit. I took it apart. It was made like a piece of shit. No wonder things sounded bad.

Get distracted trying to design some kind of setup for a sustainer pickup. An 8 ohm coil to resonate the strings with fluctuating magnetic fields. Perhaps partly because the new good pickup has more magnetic draw on the strings so the sustain now behaves a bit differently.

Spend the long weekend into Family day trying various iterations of differnt coil designs. I don't seem to have the magic wire gauge to make a coil that is powerful enough within the right impedance and form factor that would fit into the guitar after anyway.

More importantly. Looking into the couple of existing sustainer type products. They seem to be a neck configuration and bridge pickup. This is probably by desing for two reasons.

* resonating in the neck pickup position requires less energy to do so, because it is closer to the mid point of the string, not the mid pickup closer to the edge anyway.
* The resonator coil spits out a ton of garbage magnetic interference that the other pickups read. This causes horrible feedback and high speed oscillations. Maybe this is a shitty problem with the shitty simple amplifier circuit I am testing the coil with.

But sort of now having the feeling if I want to get into a sustainer pickup, i really should just concede and buy a pick up. but then that means I would likely want to buy a cheap guitar to go with it. Since not using the nice awesome Seymour Duncan Pickups I just worked so hard to put into this guitar is not something I want to do.  Physically I don't know how to create a pickup to fit in the mid pickup slot that would have enough power to resonate the strings, that would not interfere with the ohter pickups.

Cleaning the desk the baby found a plastic bin of the parts I took out from the guitar. It was one of those forgotten desk time capsules. And then the "oh yea. that".  This year I have been getting back to my classic hobbies. Finding myself again. More stuff working on the computer. More thoughtful appreciation of my hobbies. Feeling like I want to get back into playing guitar again too.

Order a Seymour Duncan Invader SH8 bridge pickup from Amazon. Put it in. Oh my gawd it sounds so much better.

Come up with the wiring for the switches to select the bridge and neck pick ups. Try to remember what I had done before. Only here instead of three pickups I only want to work with two. Order switches from digikey.

Read up on how tone knobs work. I have one there. Might as well try to use it.  Learn about treble bleed tone control circuit and wire this up with the rubbish capacitors I have in stock.

The new pickup and switches are awesome. I like having a tone control again.  Though I find any combination of using the neck pickup in the circuit makes the sound output sound like shit.  Contemplating just removing everything, use a single pick up and volume knob. Like how Eddie Van Halen did on his Jackson guitar for the "Franken Strat" build. Minimal and simplicity.
